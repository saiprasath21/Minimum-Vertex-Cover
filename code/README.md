# Algorithms for Minimum Vertex Cover

* **BnB.py** - Implements a Branch and Bound approach to compute the MVC

* **Approx.py** - Implements three different approximation algorithms (MDG, ED, and GIC). 

* **LS1.py** - Implements a simulated annealing based local search approach. 

* **LS2.py** - Implements a first-improvement hill climbing local search approach. 

* **main.py** - Executable file that calls the above algorithms and passes the parameters based on user input
